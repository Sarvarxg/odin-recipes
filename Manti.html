    <img src="manti.jpg" width="500" height="300">
    <p>Uzbek dough dishes are very diverse, yet a steamed meat dumpling called manty (manti) is a favorite of many. With its delicate dough and juicy filling, manty is filling and satisfying.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Ingredients:</strong></em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>Directions:</em></strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle, as thin as you can. Cut into 2-inch squares with a knife or pastry wheel.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle each serving with warm red pepper oil.</li>
    </ol>
    ENJOY!
